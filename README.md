# Zusor Antispam
This is a very simple Discord antispam bot built using discord.js. It works by detecting the same message by the same user in many different channels.
If that message contains a link the user is banned and the event is logged.

## Configuring the bot
To run the bot make copies of `.env.example` and `config.example.json`. Save them as `.env` and `config.json` respectively, then change the values inside the files.

## Running the bot
### Install dependencies using npm
```
$ npm install
```
### Run the bot
```
$ npm run start
```
